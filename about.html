    <p>
        Hello! this is my web page. Let me introduce my self. My name is Medhanit Woldu.
         I am the fourth child and first doughter for my parents. I was born in gimjabet maryam gojam ethiopia.
         I grew up in gimjabet maryam. my fathers name is Woldu Lakew. He was born in SNNPR andgrew up in Addis Ababa.
         He is a pharmacist.My mothers name is Wubayehu Tadele. she was born and also grew up at enjibara.she is merchant.<br><br>
         my home town gimjabet is one of ancient towns in ethiopia which is established befor 300 yers in the reignm of Aelaf seged.
         how ever ancient the town is, its development interms of enfrastructure is very backward. it has many tourist arrtactive sites.
         for example
         <ol>
             <li>Tirba lake</li>
             <li>Dangula cave</li>
             <li>Wechefo maryam monastery</li>
             <li>Zengena lake</li>

         </ol>
          <br><br>I learned my primary education at ankesha general primary school and
          secondary and preparatory education at agrw gimjabet general secondary and preparatory school. 
          I was not too bad ay my academic status. My dream was to be a cardio thorasic surgeon until i join preparatory school.
          But after i started to learning drawing after grade 11 I decided to join architectural department. and now i want to be a 
          good architect.
          <br><br>
          My child hood was very nice. Since i am the first gaugter for my family I used to have a chace of spending
           more time out
           side of our village with my elder brothers. and this creates a great chance of making many friends 
           for me.<br><br>
